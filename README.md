## Contributing
1. A python script `demo.py` that uses a pre-trained model to detect objects in a point cloud. (without downloading data | SUN RGB-D val set samples and pre-trained model provided in `demo` folder). Check `Run Demo`.
2. A python script `fasterRCNN_detections.py` that uses a pre-trained Faster RCNN model trained on the Open Images V4 dataset to output 2D object detections in the format required by ImVoteNet. Check `FasterRCNN Detections` at the end of the file.

## Installation
Overall, the installation is similar to [VoteNet](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet). GPU is required. The code is tested with Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3.7.7, PyTorch 1.4.0, CUDA 10.0 and cuDNN v7.4.

First install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), for example through [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/):
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
```
Next, install Python dependencies via `pip` ([tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) is used for for visualizations):
```bash
pip install matplotlib opencv-python plyfile tqdm networkx==2.2 trimesh==2.35.39
pip install tensorboardX --no-deps
```
Now we are ready to clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sakshee5/imvotenet.git
cd imvotenet
```
The code depends on [PointNet++](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413) as a backbone, which needs compilation:
```bash
cd pointnet2
python setup.py install
cd ..
```
## Run Demo
The pre-trained model with sample point clouds, RGB Images, Depth Maps, Camera Calib and the 2D bounding box detections are available in the demo folder. 
After completing installation, Run:
```bash
python demo.py
```
The demo uses a pre-trained model (on SUN RGB-D) to detect objects in a point cloud from an indoor room (from SUN RGB-D val set). You can use 3D visualization software such as the MeshLab to open the dumped file under `demo/results` to see the 3D detection output. Specifically, open `***_pc.ply` and `***_pred_confident_nms_bbox.ply` to see the input point cloud and predicted 3D bounding boxes. Incase you want to check the class labels of the detected objects, set `inference_switch = True` in the second last line of `demo.py`. You can check the `***_pred_map_cls.txt` to get the class labels.

The ImVoteNet model needs the point cloud as well as the geometric, semantic and texture cues extracted from the RGB Image as input. `demo.py` creates a pipeline that inputs the RGB Image, Depth Map, Camera Calib and the 2D bounding box detections (Faster RCNN 2d object detection backbone output) to output all necessary inputs for ImVoteNet model in the right format. It further uses the pre-trained model to detect objects.

## Data
Please follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet/blob/master/sunrgbd/README.md) to set up the SUN RGB-D dataset in the `sunrgbd` folder. The expected dataset structure under `sunrgbd` is:
```
sunrgbd/
  sunrgbd_pc_bbox_votes_50k_{v1,v2}_{train,val}/
  sunrgbd_trainval/
    # raw image data and camera used by ImVoteNet
    calib/*.txt
    image/*.jpg
```
For ImVoteNet, we provide 2D detection results from a pre-trained Faster R-CNN detector [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/imvotenet/2d_bbox/sunrgbd_2d_bbox_50k_v1.tgz). Please download the file, uncompress it, and place the resulting folders (`sunrgbd_2d_bbox_50k_v1_{train,val}`) under `sunrgbd` as well.

## Training and Evaluation

Once the code and data are set up, one can train ImVoteNet by the following command:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --use_imvotenet --log_dir log_imvotenet
```
The setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` forces the model to be trained on a single GPU (GPU `0` in this case). With the default batch size of 8, it takes about 7G memory during training. 

To reproduce the experimental results in the paper and in general have faster development cycles, one can use a shorter learning schedule: 
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python train.py --use_imvotenet --log_dir log_140ep --max_epoch 140 --lr_decay_steps 80,120 --lr_decay_rates 0.1,0.1
```

As a baseline, this code also supports training of the original VoteNet, which is launched by:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python train.py --log_dir log_votenet
```
In fact, the code is based on the VoteNet repository at commit [2f6d6d3](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet/tree/2f6d6d3), as a reference, it gives around 58 mAP@0.25.

For other training options, one can use `python train.py -h` for assistance.

After the model is trained, the checkpoint can be tested and evaluated on the `val` set via:
```bash
python eval.py --use_imvotenet --checkpoint_path log_imvotenet/checkpoint.tar --dump_dir eval_imvotenet --cluster_sampling seed_fps --use_3d_nms --use_cls_nms --per_class_proposal
```
For reference, ImVoteNet gives around 63 mAP@0.25.

## TODO
- Add docs for some functions
- Investigate the 0.5 mAP@0.25 gap after moving to PyTorch 1.4.0. (Originally the code is based on PyTorch 1.0.)

## FasterRCNN Detections
The official ImVoteNet repository does not provide the pre-trained Faster RCNN model. Instead you are directly supposed to download the `.txt` files and use them for training.

(Refer: For ImVoteNet, we provide 2D detection results from a pre-trained Faster R-CNN detector [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/imvotenet/2d_bbox/sunrgbd_2d_bbox_50k_v1.tgz).)

Currently the `demo.py` script directly uses RGB Images from the SUN RGB-D val dataset and thus the 2D bbox detections can directly be downloaded and used. But incase we want to run the demo script on a custom RGB Image, we need the 2D bbox detection in the right format to run the demo script. 

`fasterRCNN_detections.py` uses a pretrained Faster RCNN on Open Images V4 Dataset from the tensorflow-hub. It's been trained on 600 categories with ImageNet pre-trained Inception Resnet V2 as image feature extractor. The inference block added in the script makes sure that only objects of interest are detected and saved in a `.txt` file as required by ImvoteNet.

Firtly install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install tensorflow-hub

```
Run:
```bash
python fasterRCNN_detections.py
```
Check `demo/FasterRCNN_labels` to get the corresponding text file which can inturn be used with the `demo.py` script. 

#### Categories of interest from sun rgbd | possible category from the 600 categories of Open Images Dataset <br />
bed         | Bed    <br /> 
table       | Table <br />

## Fixes
3. Error while compiling PointNet2 with newer/higher CUDA version (like CUDA>=11.0) <br />
   FIX:
   1. Change all instances of AT_CHECK to TORCH_CHECK inside all the source files inside `pointnet2/_ext_src/src and pointnet2/_ext_src/include`. This is due       to an API change in PyTorch.  
   2. Change pointnet2/setup.py:
      ```bash

      )
      _ext_headers = glob.glob("{}/include/*".format(_ext_src_root))

          cmdclass={
              'build_ext': BuildExtension
          }
      )
     ```

2. Error message before training: ImportError: No module named 'google' <br />
   FIX: Run <br />
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
   ```
 
3. Error message: AttributeError: ‘Fraction’ object has no attribute ‘gcd’ <br />
   FIX: <br />
   A minor change is needed in the site-packages of your virtual environment. <br />
   Open `path to env/lib/python_3.8/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/dag.py`<br />
   Change `from fractions import gcd` to `import math` <br />
   Change the one gcd instance in the file from `gcd()` to `math.gcd()` <br />
